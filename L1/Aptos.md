Aptos
===========

Aptos is an L1 that emphasizes safety and scalability. The Aptos VM is written in Rust, while its smart contract logic is based on the Move language. 
Move represents digital assets as programmable resources: data that can be moved from account to account, but not reused, duplicated, or discarded. Developers can publish [Move Modules](https://aptos.dev/tutorials/your-first-move-module) for creating, transferring, or storing assets to the Aptos blockchain. Aptos has both FullNodes (read-only) and Validator Nodes, both of which have a RESTful API.


## Blockchain
Aptos uses a version of Hotstuff BFT consensus, has an advertised TPS of >100k, and allows for parallel account transactions.
