Polygon
=========

Polygon is a sidechain that uses a modified Tendermint PoS consensus mechanism for transaction ordering/inclusion. 

It features two chains:
* Heimdall Chain - responsible for selecting Bor validator sets and checkpointing balances back to the main chain (Ethereum)
* Bor Chain - responsible for executing smart contracts and producing blocks.
