Economic Design
================

On this page we'll try to collect resources about interesting protocol designs.


## Incentive design
There is much discussion (e.g. on Twitter) about the security implications of various blockchains'
economic designs.  The below links give a taste of the considerations, although they are certainly

* [Blockchain Resource Pricing](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/pricing/ethpricing.pdf)
* [Staking Pools, Staking Derivatives, and Eth2.0 Security](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/04/on-staking-pools-and-staking-derivatives/)

  pool), formulated nicely for computation only when pool balances change
